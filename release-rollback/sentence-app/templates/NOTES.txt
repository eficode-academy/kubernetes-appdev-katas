This info will be displayed when you either install or upgrade your release
You can use actions in here like display the namespace it will be deployed to:
{{ .Release.Namespace }}

Or the example that helm.sh has:
Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}
