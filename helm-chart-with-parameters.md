# Helm Chart with Parameters

This exercise will demonstrate adding parameters to a Helm chart to allow
customization of the installed application.

This exercise extends the Helm chart created in the
[create-a-helm-chart](create-a-helm-chart.md) exercise.

We will add the following options for customization:

- Configurable Kubernetes resource naming (using Helm built-in values)
- Configurable number of POD replicas in deployments (using single-value parameters with defaults)
- Configurable resource settings (using list-type value parameters)
- Optional definitions (using if/else constructs)

when we initially created the Helm chart we did it with an empty values.yaml
file.  Now replace the `values.yaml` with the following content:

```
## sentence configured the main sentences micro-service
sentences:
  ## replicas is the number of POD replicas
  replicas: 1
  ## image contains the POD container image parameters
  image:
    repository: releasepraqma/sentence
    tag: latest
  ## resource requests and limits
  resources: {}
  service:
    ## type is the type of the service fronting the sentence application
    type: NodePort
    ## nodePort is the actual port used for NodePort-type services
    #nodePort:
```

> Note that the Helm best practices suggests using a flat values file vs. a
> nested one as shown above. Real-world charts however, very often use nested
> values and this is probably the defacto standard. For more info look [here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_best_practices/values/)

This `values.yaml` file shows:

- Using double `##` for documentation comments and single `#` for commented-out fields. This is not an official Helm standard but a very common approach.
- Image name and tag are separately configurable. This is a common pattern because the tag typically is configured independently from the image name.
- POD resource settings are not defaulted in `values.yaml`. We cannot know the proper settings and instead we provide an empty map and allows users to set appropriate resource requests.
- The `nodePort` parameter (which is only relevant in case the Kubernetes service is of type `NodePort`) has no default. Again, we cannot know the proper default but instead indicate in the `values.yaml` file that there is a parameter that can be configured. Another typically used alternative for string-type values with no good default is to leave them as empty strings.

## Adding Parameters to the Chart

Now we need to update the chart template files such that values are inserted at
the appropriate places. We do that using the `{{` and `}}` template language
constructions.

In the template file `sentence-app/templates/sentences-deployment.yaml` file,
locate the first `spec` of the deployment manifest, i.e. the part that starts
with:

```
...
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      ...
```

and add a line with a `replicas` specification as follows:

```
...
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.sentences.replicas }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      ...
```

Verify the rendering as follows:

```shell
# inside helm-chart/
$ helm template sentence-app/ --show-only templates/sentences-deployment.yaml
```

Since `values.yaml` have a default replica count of 1 that is what we see in the
rendered `sentences-deployment.yaml` template.

You can try changing the default, or explicitly override the value in the helm
invocation as follows:

```shell
$ helm template sentence-app/ --show-only templates/sentences-deployment.yaml --set sentences.replicas=3
```

Similarly, change the container image specification as follows:

```
      - image: {{ .Values.sentences.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.sentences.image.tag }}
```

and change the Deployment name as follows:

```
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-sentences
```

The resource section is slightly different since this is not a single value but
instead a full YAML map. Also, we do not know whether the user will specify
limits or requests for either CPU or memory since all this is related to the
actual usage.

Instead we simply insert the full YAML as given by the user. To do this we use a
Helm function and pipeline as follows.

Change the hard-coded resource settings from:

```
...
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 0.25
          limits:
            cpu: 0.25
```

to:

```
...
        resources:
{{ toYaml .Values.sentences.resources | indent 10 }}
```

As before, validate the resource setting with the following command. Pay
particularly attention to indentation on the rendered YAML.

```shell
$ helm template sentence-app/ --set sentences.resources.requests.cpu=0.25 --show-only templates/sentences-deployment.yaml
```

## Adding Conditional Rendering of Template

Kubernetes allows us to define which port to use for services of type
NodePort. I.e. we will customize the Kubernetes YAML for this scenario.

In the template file `sentence-app/templates/sentences-svc.yaml` file, locate

the specification of the service type:

```
...
  type: NodePort
...
```

Change this line and add nodeport specification as follows:

```
...
  type: {{ .Values.sentences.service.type }}
...
```

and locate the specification of the port mapping:

```
...
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
...
```

And add the conditional nodeport specification as follows:

```
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
    {{ if and (eq .Values.sentences.service.type "NodePort") .Values.sentences.service.nodePort -}}
    nodePort: {{ .Values.sentences.service.nodePort }}
    {{- end }}
```

Note the "prefix notation" used with `and` and `eq` in the above specification.

Test the rendering of the service with the following commands and observe the difference depending on the settings of `nodePort`:

```shell
$ helm template sentence-app/ --show-only templates/sentences-svc.yaml --set sentences.service.type=NodePort
$ helm template sentence-app/ --show-only templates/sentences-svc.yaml --set sentences.service.nodePort=30000,sentences.service.type=NodePort
$ helm template sentence-app/ --show-only templates/sentences-svc.yaml --set sentences.service.nodePort=30000,sentences.service.type=ClusterIP
```

## Values Files

When multiple variables needs to be set, its more convenient to have them
collected in files. Try this by creating a file called `values-resources.yaml`
with the following content:

```
sentences:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 0.25
    limits:
      cpu: 0.25
```

and test template rendering with:

```shell
$ helm template sentence-app/ --values values-resources.yaml --show-only templates/sentences-deployment.yaml
```

Validate the chart and install the sentences application using the new chart:

```shell
$ helm lint sentence-app/
$ helm install sentences sentence-app/
```

This will install the chart with the default values. (Hint: use `kubectl get pods` to see the running pods.) 

Try upgrading the chart
using an increased replica count:

```shell
$ helm upgrade sentences sentence-app/ --set sentences.replicas=3
```

Finally, inspect the chart status and actual values:

```shell
$ helm list
$ helm get all sentences
$ helm get values sentences
```

Note that the `get` operation show the used values in the beginning as `USER-SUPPLIED VALUES` and `COMPUTED VALUES`.

# Food for Thought

When doing horizontal POD autoscaling using the HorizontalPODAutoscaler (HPA)
Kubernetes resource, its best practice not to define the number of replicas in
your `Deployment` YAML resource definitions. If you want to create a Helm chart
that supports both manual scaling through a replicas parameter and automatic
scaling with HPA how would you do that?

## Cleanup

Delete the application installed with Helm:

```shell
$ helm delete sentences
```
